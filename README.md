# Charity_app
My first project where I try to practice everything I know about Web Development

Developed a Django-based web app for 'Club for Future' charity.
Followed the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern to ensure a well-structured application.
Crafted 8 apps, comprising over 30 pages with both function and class-based views for a seamless user experience.
Utilized more than 10 models to efficiently manage and organize data.
Designed the frontend with Bootstrap, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface.
Implemented role-based access control to safeguard sensitive information and features.
Prioritized security measures, including data validation and the production of high-quality, maintainable code.
Employed PostgreSQL as the relational database system, ensuring robust data management and retrieval.
