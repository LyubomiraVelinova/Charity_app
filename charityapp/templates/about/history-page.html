                        "Caps for the Future" was launched in October 2017. The main objective of the first campaign was
                        of donating at least one CUVYOZ to a hospital in a less populated area. To everyone's surprise,
                        we were able to donate the first one just FIVE weeks after our first campaign at the end of
                        October. For 5 years, the campaign not only continues to gather strength and funds, but also its
                        creator founded Clubs for the Future.

                        Since our humble beginnings in 2017, our charity project has grown into a powerful force of
                        positive change, touching countless lives and making a difference in the community. It all
                        started with a simple idea - collecting caps - but soon evolved into a profound mission to
                        transform lives.
