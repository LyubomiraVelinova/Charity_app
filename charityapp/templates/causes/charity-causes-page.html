                        "Caps for Future" campaigns are a powerful initiative that aims to collect plastic
                        caps, rings, and handles of beverage bottles from all over Bulgaria. These plastic caps are then
                        recycled into secondary raw materials, and with the funds generated, we purchase life-saving
                        equipment like incubators for premature babies or children's neonatal ambulances. It's
                        incredible to witness the impact of a small plastic cap in creating a big difference in the
                        lives of our little ones.

                        Through our Recycling for Future Campaigns, we aim to create a sustainable future by collecting
                        recycled garbage and giving it new life. With a strong commitment to environmental conservation,
                        we collect various recyclable items such as glass jars, including children's purees and bottles,
                        as well as cans of infant formula and dog/cat food. Additionally, we focus on PET bottles,
                        specifically those from soft drinks and beer, marked with "ALU," mainly sourced from mineral
                        water, non-alcoholic beverages, and beer. The collected recyclables are sent for responsible
                        recycling and converted into valuable resources. By doing so, we not only contribute to reducing
                        waste and pollution but also generate funds that enable us to make a tangible difference in our
                        communities. With the earnings from the Recycling for Future Campaigns, we invest in purchasing
                        bins for our cities. These bins play a vital role in promoting proper waste disposal and
                        encouraging more individuals to participate in recycling efforts.
